This is a brief guide to the problems Iâ€™ve solved on the 2024 MIT Integration
Bee Qualifying Exam. These solutions are by no means the only way of solving
the listed problems or the optimal solutions. These are my attempts at creating
a comprehensive guide for my intuition and how I approached these problems.
These answers have been verified with the 2024 MIT Integration Bee Qualifying
Exam released answers. For certain questions involving the use of logarithms,
I had to substitute the use of log (which implies the use of base 10) with the
natural log (ln) to match the released answer key mathematically. These ques-
tions will be marked so that you know which questions have been altered. The
rest of the questions remain unchanged with their appearance on the released
2024 MIT Integration Bee Qualifying Exam. I apologize in advance for any
grammatical errors or formatting inconsistencies in this solution guide.
Best,
Pablo Pena
